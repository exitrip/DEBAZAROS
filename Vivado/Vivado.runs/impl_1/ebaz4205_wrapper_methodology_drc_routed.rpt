TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_out1_ebaz4205_clk_wiz_0_2 and clk_out2_ebaz4205_clk_wiz_0_1 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.

RAM retargeting possibility  
Identified 12 RAM32X1D primitives that could be retargeted to RAM32M. Retargeting will save approximately 4 memory LUTs and improve routability. These can usually be achieved using synthesis inference or XPMs. The memories are ebaz4205_i/FILTER_FT/FIR_FT_IQ_2/U0/i_synth/g_polyphase_decimation.i_polyphase_decimation/g_parallel.g_paths[0].g_symmetric.i_data_wrap_buff/i_phase_mem/gen_dram.ram_reg_0_15_0_0,
