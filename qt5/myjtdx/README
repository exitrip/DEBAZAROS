JTDX is forked from  WSJT-X, a computer  program  dedicated to amateur
radio communication using very weak signals. 

The program runs equally well on Windows, Macintosh and Linux systems,
and installation packages are available for all three platforms.

JTDX  is  an  open-source project released under the  GPL license (See

# Overview

This is the myjtdx C++ software to decode FT8 (and maybe other digital modes) using the EBAZ4205_SDR_spectrum project.

# Software architecture

* main.cpp is the classical main for qt5 applications
* mainwindow.cpp is the mainwindow of the user interface of jtdx, pretty similar to the UI of wsjt-x
