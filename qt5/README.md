This is the sdr-app C++ software receiving sampled data from EBAZ4205 and displaying spectrum and waterfall in its User Interface.
It lets you to send commands to EBA4205 also to:
  * switch between the ADC input and a local RF test generator  
  * change the local RF test generator frequency in the range 100 KHz - 32 MHz
  * tune radio stations 
  * change the waterfall colors (TODO)
  * Set IF bandwith and IF gain
